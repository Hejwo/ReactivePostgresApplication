### Reactive Postgres Application wuth Spring WebFlux & R2BDC

####1. Motivation
Purpose of this repository is creating real-life application example of Spring WebFlux and R2DBC.  
Across the web I've found a lot of simple tutorials about configuring R2DBC, but couldn't find a complete example 
matching real-life problems.  
So here's my try.  
     
####2. Organization
I try to keep my git commits clean so you can easily follow history and configure your own project based on them.


####3. TODOs
1. Basic project creation (including adding Spock and `integrationTest` module)  
2. Added newest, properly configured R2DBC  
3. Added embedded Postgres  
4. Created first `ReactiveRepository` -> UserRepository
